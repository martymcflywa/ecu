# Academic Writing

>M. Brogan & B. Combes

## Academic Writing and Reasoning

- Academic writing and reasoning are essential for success at University
- Most academic writing involves argumentation in which the author attempts to prove one or more claims
	- With evidence based argument written in academic style

>Rhetoric -> Argumentation <- Dialectic

## On good and bad writing

>"I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien [sic] to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to tolerate"

>Whoops! - Professor Harold Laski (Essay in Freedom of Expression)

What's wrong with this?

Perhaps it is the case that Milton, who once seemed like a 17th Century Shelley, became increasingly bitter and alienated by the founder of the Jesuits, a sect that he deplored?

## Meta cognitive reflection

Self assess the current state of your writing. Discuss your answers with a partner

1. What writing do you do at the moment?
2. What do you like about your approach to writing at the moment?
3. What do you dislike about your current writing strategies?
4. Are there any aspects of academic writing that make you uneasy?
5. What do you think would help you to become a successful academic writer?

## What is Academic Writing

- The term genres is used to describe categories of written texts that have recognizable patters, syntax, techniques and/or conventions. (Duke University, 2012)
- Academic writing is a distinct genre
	- Evidence based argument proceeding from a thesis or questions leading to a thesis statement
	- Emphasis on proof of a claim, authority and verification
	- Not commentary, nor journalism

## Features of Academic Writing

>Moore, S. (2010). The Ultimate Study Skills Handbook. London. Open University Press. p.100

- Explication
	- Academic texts lay out in explicit terms, the aims and scope of their content
	- They tend to provide a roadmap of key hypotheses, arugments and ideas
	- Usually contain conclusions that reiterate and re-emphasize these key dimensions of the text
- Objectivity / detachment
	- Academic texts typically establish a detached and objective orientation to the topics they explore
	- There tends to be a *rhetoric distance* between the reader and the writer
- Intertextuality: References to other texts
	- Academic texts are possibly more distinguished from other forms of text by frequent reference to the ideas, research or perspectives of other writers in the field
	- These references are cited in highly conventional and rule-bound ways
- Rationality
	- Academic texts often display a rational, logical and *scientific* approach to argument, evidence and *proof*
	- This scientific approach has come to dominate many fields of academic enquiry, even where such an approach may not be strictly necessary or even appropriate
- Critical thinking
	- Academic writing tends to be more valued if it demonstrates critical approach to the material it is exploring
	- A critical approach requires not taking evidence or explanations at face value, finding ways of exploring and exposing underlying assumptions and challenging prevailing dogma or *received wisdom*

>### Extract 1

>According to recent research by the Mauna Loa Observatory, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached all time high. Following extensive research, scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory concluded that CO2 levels in the atmosphere is now 387 parts per million (ppm), that is a rise of almost 40% since the industrial revolution and the highest for at least the last 650,000 years. The research, published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also confirms that carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than originally expected. The annual mean growth rate for 2007 was 2.14ppm, - the fourth year in six to see an annual rise greater then 2ppm. From 1970 to 2000, the concentration rose by about 1.5ppm each year but since 2000 the annual rise has leapt to an average 2.1ppm.

>### Extract 2

>The amount of carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere is really high, I think that this is very worrying for scientists and the general population. Apparently, CO2 levels in the atmosphere is now 387 parts per million (ppm), that is a really big rise of almost 40% and the highest for at least the last 650,000 years! This research was published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These people also confirm that there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It's accumulating faster than they thought it would. The annual mean growth rate for 2007 was 2.14ppm, this is happening all the time now, it the fourth year recently to see an annual rise greater then 2ppm. From 1970 to 2000, the concentration rose by about 1.5ppm each year but since 2000 the annual rise has gone up to an average 2.1ppm.

These two extracts contain the same information. Read them both. Which is written in academic style? Why? How might this extract have been improved as a piece of academic writing?

Extract 1 is in academic writing style. It uses formal language, evidence, is objective and is written eloquently. It could have been improved with citations.

### Non Academic Style

>Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, And so are you!

### Academic Style

>Recent studies have shown that although many roses are indeed red, they can be found in a multitude of colours including, pink, yellow and and orange. (Dimmick et al, 2005, Bill and Ben, 2006) Violets, however, have been shown to be almost always blue, with some exceptions noted in the excellent work carried out by Titchmarch et al (2008). In addition, but not directly related to this, sucrose has been shown to produce a sweet flavour when consumed my most adults (S. Martie at el 2001, M. Asrbar 1996). Although one would personally describe the subject in question as a 'sweet', this is not scientifically sound as the subject is not, of course, an item of confectionery

## Academic Style

- A piece of academic writing must be a concise, coherent, detailed and logically structured exploration / examination of ideas
- Use of language is formal
- Avoid colloquialisms
	- Slang
	- Street language
	- Chat language
	- Abbreviations
		- Don't use etc or &
- When using an acronym, write the title in full the first time followed by the acronym
	- For example, "Information Communications Technologies (ICT)"
- Use third person
	- Not I or my
- Write clearly for maximum understanding

## Grammar

- General rule:
	- If you don't know how to use it correctly, then don't use it
		- For example, `:`, `;` or `-`
- Proofread
	- Don't rely on spell checker
	- Read work aloud
		- Helps to identify bad sentence construction and grammatical errors
- Keep sentences short rather than long
	- Single sentence containing a list of points separated by `:` or `;` presents a stream of consciousness, not a logical argument

	- Broader list of works you consulted while preparing the paper, but may not have actually referred to directly
	- Do not supply a bibliography unless requested

## Paragraphs and Topic Sentences

- Many students lose marks un-necessarily because they do not follow simple writing conventions
- Organising work into paragraphs is a convention for producing readble, coherent, logical, persuasive work
	- A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organised and coherent
	- Are all related to a single topic
	- Every piece of writing that is longer than a few sentences should be organised into paragraphs
	- Paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end
	- Helps the reader see the organisation of the essay and grasp its main points (Indiana Univesity)

## Paragraphs

- Paragraphs prove or demonstrate a thesis through explanations, examples and concrete details
- A paragraph is unified when every sentence develops the point made in the topic sentence
- It must have a single focus and it must contain no irrelevant facts

### Paragraph Structure

- Three most common types of paragraph structure are:
	- Development by detail
	- Comparison and contrast
	- Process

#### Development by Detail

- The most common and easiest form of paragraph development
- Simply expand on a general topic sentence using specific examples or illustrations to support your argument

>**Work tends to be associated with non-work specific environments, activities and schedules**. If asked what space is reserved for learning, many students would suggest the classroom, or the lab. What about the kitchen? The bedroom? In fact, any room in which a student habitually studies becomes a learning space, or a place associated with thinking. Some people need to engage in sports or other physical activity before they can work successfully. Being sedentray seems to inspire others. Some students do their best work before the sun rises, some after it sets. Some need a less flexible schedule that others, while a few can sit and not rise until their task is done. Some students work quickly and efficiently, while others cannot produce anything without much dust and heat.

#### Development by Contrast

- Useful when describing two or more things which have something, but not everything in common
- You may choose to compare either point by point
	- "X is big, Y is little; X and Y are both purple"
- Or subject by subject
	- "X is big and purple; Y is small and purple"

#### Development by Process

- Involves straight-forward step by step description
- Can be recognised as the formula followed in the method section of a lab experiment
- Process description often follows a chronological sequence

>The first point to establish is the **grip of the hand on the rod**. This should be about half-way up the cork handle, absolutely firm and solid, but not tense or rigid. All four fingers are curved around the handle, the little finger, third finger and middle finger contributing most of the firmness by pressing the cork solidly into the fleshy part of the palm, near the heel of the hand. The forefinger supports and steadies the grip but supplies its own firmness against the thumb, which should be along the upper side of the handle and somewhere near the top of the grip. (From Roderick Haig-Brown, "Fly Casting")

## Topic Sentences

>Indiana University. (2004). *Paragraphs and Topic Sentences.* Retrieved Auguist 26, 2014, from http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/paragraphs.shtml

- A well-organised paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence
- A topic sentence has several important functions: (Indiana University, 2004)
	- It substantiates or supports an essay's thesis statement
	- It unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences
	- It advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it

### Example: Announce the Topic

Announce the topic:

>Many fast-food chains make their profits from adding a special ingredient called **forget sauce** to their foods.

- All sentences in the paragraph must relate in some way to **fast food**, **profit** and **forget sauce**
- Rest of the paragraph:

>**Many fast-food chains make their profits from adding a special ingredient called forget sauce to their foods**. Made largley from edible oil products, this condiment is never listed on the menu. In addition, this well kept industry secret is the reason why **ingredients** are never listed on the packaging of victuals sold by these restaurants. **Forget sauce** has a chemical property which causes temporary amnesia in consumers. After spending too much money on barely edible food bereft of any nutritional value, most consumers swear they will never repeat such a disagreeable experience. Within a short period, however, the chemical in **forget sauce** takes effect, and they can be depended upon to return and spend, older but no wiser.

### Forecasting

While it is typical to begin a paragraph with a topic sentence, a topic sentence can occur elsewhere in the paragraph when serving some other purpose. For example, a topic sentence might occur mid paragraph forecasting the discussion to come:

>When we think of Ghandi fasting, plastering mud poultices on his belly, and testing his vow of continence by sharing a bed with his grand-niece, we can easily regard him as a fanatic who happened to be politically lucky. **But the links between his private fads and his political methods turn out to be quite logical**. Ghandi's pursuit of personal rigors helped him to achieve a rare degree of discipline that allowed him to approach political crises with amazing courage. The example of his self-control, furthermore, was contagious; a more worldly man could not have led millions of his countrymen to adopt the tactic of non-violent resistance. (Crews 104)

## Review as You Write

- Check the thesis statement and questions
- Remember that you are writing for others
- Check your planning document
- Check the sequence of the argument, coherence and flow
	- Topic sentences
	- Links between paragraphs
- Use active verbs
	- **Bad:** Inflation is a threat to our economy
	- **Good:** Inflation threatens our economy
- Avoid using stretcher phrases such as **it is** and **there are**
	- **Bad:** There are several reasons for Australia's entrance into the war
	- **Good:** Australia entered the war for several reasons
- Replace colloquialisms / slang with fresh and more precise statements
	- **Bad:** Her behaviour flipped me out
	- **Good:** Her behaviour first stunned, then delighted me
- Cut out wordiness wherever possible
	- **Bad:** They are desirous of...
	- **Good:** They want...
- Avoid fragmented sentences and paragraphs
	- A good way to smooth out such a problem is to try combining sentences
		- This shows the relationship between them
	- **Bad:** The best show in terms of creating a tense atmosphere is "Jeopardy". This is probably the most famous of all game shows
	- **Good:** The best show in terms of creating a tense atmosphere is "Jeopardy", which is also probably the most famous of all game shows
- Remember that others will be reading your paper
	- Choice of words can affect their response
	- Try to anticipate response, and choose words accordingly
	- **Bad:** The media's explotation of the Watergate scandal showed how biased it already was
	- **GoodL** The media's coverage of the Watergate scandal suggests that perhaps those in the media had already determined Nixon's guilt

## Proof Reading

- Always leave some time between finishing and checking
- Try to use a consistent system of correction marks
- Read your work aloud
	- This will help identify awkward sentences
- Get a friend, colleague or family member to proof read a second time

### Things to Look For

- Sentence sense
- Correct spelling
- Capital letters
- Abbreviations
- Numbering
- Continuity of material
- Names, numbers, dates
- All sources acknowledged
- Correct referencing
- Correspondence between in-text and end-text references

## Good Practice

- Use 12 or 11 pt serif font, unless directed otherwise
	- eg. Times New Roman
- Use numerals for dates
	- 1980s
- Numbers under 1000 are written in full
	- Ninety-nine
- When writing an article for publication, make sure you follow the layout and referencing as directed by the publishers

## Intellectual Property

- Copyright
	- Trading system for works of the mind
	- Copyright originally intended to protect authors of literacy and artistic works
	- Technical inventions protected by patents
	- Trademark protected through registration process
	- Rights of copyright may vary according to the subject matter
		- Basically they include the right to copy, adapt, perform and broadcast the subject matter

### Legal Considerations

- Two principal categories of materials:
	- **Works** which include
		- Literary
		- Dramatic
		- Musical
		- Artistic
	- **Subject matter other than works** include
		- Sound recordings
		- Films
		- Television broadcast
		- Radio broadcast
- There are national and international laws and agreements that govern copyright
	- Australian law includes the idea of fair dealing

### Fair Dealing

- Describes the notion of permitted re-use of a portion of a work for a permitted use without prior agreement of the copyright holder
	- For educational use, under Australian copyright law
		- 10% of book or e-book or a chapter, whichever is larger
- Such uses include
	- Purpose of private research or study
	- Criticism
	- Reporting news and judicial proceedings
	- Multiple copies of small portions of literary and dramatic works by educational institutions
- Fair dealing
	- Classroom performance of work
	- Use of copyright material in exams
	- Copying of copyright materials for purposes of non-profit libraries and archives
	- Playing of sound recordings in residential premises for residents and in clubs
- Unfair dealing is the idea of publication, sharing or broadcasting more than a 'fair' portion of a work for personal, commercial gain, or for an unapproved use
	- Peer to peer file sharing of videos and music

### Copyright and the Net

- If you participate in newsgroups and re-transmit electronic mail or web pages among participants, you may violate the originators copyright
	- It is unclear whether downloading news stories and reprinting them is an infringement
- Web pages are protected by copyright
	- Even if the information is public domain, the design, layout elements, if original are protected
- Saving HTML source code to reuse as a template for a web page is a copyright violation
- Lists of links may not be copyrightable, but if original thought was used to create them, they may be (Ardito, S. 1996 pp. 88)
	- Many electronic copyright issues have yet to be tested in the courts and it is wise to take a conservative approach by obtaining permission from the original owner before reproducing material
	- Images are copyright too
- If in doubt
	- Check the FAQ at the [Australian Copyright Council](http://www.copyright.org.au/find-an-answer/)
- Fines for abuse of copyright are prohibitive
	- Copyright at [ECU](http://www.ecu.edu.au/GPPS/copyright/ )

### Other Legal Considerations

- Concerned with the damaging of someone's reputation
- Saying something about another person that is considered damaging to their reputation
- Must be heard or read by a third party
- Truth is not a defense in defamation cases
- You cannot defame people in email or on newsgroups

#### Avoiding Defamation

- Exercise care when talking about someone in formal or group situations
- Realise that an email message is considered to be a publication for legal purposes
- Realise that web based newsgroups and chats are a public forum and that everything you say on them is stored somewhere and is searchable

### Plagiarism

- A form of theft
- Using the works of others without acknowledgement
- Attracts severe penalties from receiving no marks for your assignment to exclusion from the University
- See Lecture in Module 3

#### Avoiding Plagiarism

- Take clear accurate notes about where you found specific ideas
- Write down the complete citation information for each item that you use
	- Use quotation marks when directly stating another person's words
- Always credit original authors for their information and ideas
- Remember that showing that your work draws on the accumulated knowledge of the field demonstrates the depth and breadth of your research and understandings of existing research
