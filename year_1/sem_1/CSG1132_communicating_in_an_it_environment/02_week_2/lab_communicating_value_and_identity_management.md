## Assignment 1A Task 1: Concept Map

The concept map should demonstrate understanding of the full nature of the role that user psychology plays with Facebook. It is important to be:

- Be comprehensive of the domain problem
	- Elaborate on factors that user psychology shapes personal use
- Impose structure via clustering and hierarchy
	- See example in assignment brief
- Identify relations between concepts
	- A concept map is not a mind map

### Form and Structure

In a concept map, concepts are represented in a hierarchial fashion, with the most inclusive, most general concepts at the top of the map and more specific, less general concepts arranged hierarically below.

>Focus question: What factors in user psychology shape personal use of Facebook?

#### Example:

Self-affirmation. The peer reviewed literature suggests that the user's need to experience self-affirmation is an importan psychological factor in personal use of social media.
