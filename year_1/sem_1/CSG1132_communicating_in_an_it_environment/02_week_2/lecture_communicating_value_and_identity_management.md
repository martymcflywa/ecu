## Communicating / Learning

### Metacognition

- Thinking about how you learn, analyse and think
- Asking questions
- Examines in detail
- Thinks outside the square (laterally)
- Pays attention to detail
- Seeks to improve and upskill
- Has the capacity to learn how to learn

### Thinking About Thinking

- Metacognition can be thought of as "thinking about thinking"
- Metacognition helps people to think more effectively
- Some strategies include:
	- Self questioning
		- "What is my prior learning of the topic"
		- "How have I solved problems like this before"
	- Making graphic representations
		- Concept maps
		- Flow charts
		- Semantic webs
	- Writing and narrative
		- Writing lecture notes

### Mapping the Problem Domain

- When problem solving in new domains, a metacognitive thinker will:
	- Create a conceptual boundary around what is being investigated
		- Scoping reduces problem to a manageable number of variables
	- Map concepts within the domain in terms of hierarchy and relations
		- Identifies variables and relations between them
	- Technique is called mind or concept mapping

### Mapping the Business Value of IT

- What is a business case?
- For ICT, what kinds of business benefits exist?

See `communicating_value_identity_managent.todo`

## Class Activity - Concept Map

- Draw concept maps for focus questions A & B
	- B is a sub topic of A
- In 2011, Harvey Norman released a new online store, and moved from brick and mortar retailing to a hybrid business model which included web store retailing
	- What kinds of business value can it expect online?
		- Try to think of an hypothesis

## Case Study in Benefit Realization: Small Business E-Shop

- A small publishing business maintains online store that generated $26,117 worth of online sales in 2011.
- In 2010, management commited to redevelop the existing web store which incurred development costs of 
	- $18,953 in 2010
	- $32,159 in 2011.
- Variable annual on-going costs included
	- hosting $2,230
	- e-newsletter to customers $2,798
- The new shop went live at the start of 2012
- The business is unsure whether it has invested wisely, and has sought the advice of a **business analyst**

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

- It is a method of measuring cumulative costs and benefits of systems over their projected lifetimes
- Business Analyst begins with a TCO based on the available data
- **Payback** is the time taken to recoup the investment
	1. Complete TOC table
		- Calculate total for year 2
		- Add hosting cost for year 3
		- Calculate annual cost of system for year 5
	2. Complete Payback analysis
		- Cumulative cost calculated by adding cost for current year + previous years
		- Benefits are the same
		- Cumulative benefits calculated with same method as cumulative cost
	3. What assumptions have been made? Are they realistic?

## Visualisation

- Learn how to create graphs in Excel
- Charts make it easier to see patterns in numbers
- As a business analyst, what will you advise?
- Is the payback (after 4 years) realistic for the business?

## Summary

- Researched a problem domain
- Represented domain in terms of concepts
- Concept mapping has created scope
- Refined topic area with a subtopic area: ICT Business Benefits
- Using subtopics, devised algorithmic approach, TCO to problem solve
- Explored issues to go with organization and presentation of numerical data from an investigation using the problem solving method (TCO)

## Netiquette Guidelines

- Read the Internet Engineering Task Force Netiquette guidelines.

## Class Activity - Netiquette

- What is *flame*? Why does the experience of Internet communications lead to flaming?
- Outline the consequences of not changing the subject line in email communication
- What is Bcc and why is it bad practice?

## Identity Management - Social Media

- The proliferation of social media has created opportunites and risks
	- How you manage social personas online can have implications for your career
	- Employers routinely data mine social media for information about current and prospective employees
- Risk management begins with understanding whether services should be regarded as professional, personal or blended
- Allocate the following services into the table below
	- LinkedIn
	- Facebook
	- Delicious
	- Flickr
	- Twitter
	- Tumblr
	- LiveJournal
	- Yammer
	- Instagram
	- Pinterest

| Professional only | Blended  | Personal Only |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| LinkedIn          | Facebook | Delicious     |

- Describe the implications for:
	- The kind of content you upload
	- The security precautions you take
- If you restrict access to your **Facebook** site to friends only, does this guarantee your privacy and protect you from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure? Why?
- Does applications integration increase the likelyhood of disclosure?
- The power of a network can be related to the number of nodes it contains.
	- Describe implications of network power for:
		- Facebook
		- LinkedIn
- Research one or more case studies in risk associated with Twitter

## Managing Risk and Reaping the Rewards

- As with email, you can manage the risks and reap the rewards by following some simple precautions
	- Silo the personal from the professional and don't confuse these personas with inappropriate uploads
	- Be aware that silos can be broken down creating risk
- If you are courting controversy, sleep on it before uploading
- Avoid racist and illegal uploads. Linking such sources should be avoided
- Understand and apply security and privacy settings
