# Descriptive statistics

>Dr. M. Brogan

## Introduction

- In Week 3, we explored pathways to knowledge including:
	- Rationalism
	- Empiricalism
- What is 
	- Rationalism?
	- Empiricalism?
	- Scientific method?
- Two basic methods of argument were identified
	- Induction
	- Deduction

## Argumentation

- Induction
	- Inductive reasoning starts from specific observations or sensory experiences and then develops a general conclusion from them (Walliman, 2011)
- Deduction
	- Deductive reasoning begins with general statements or premises and through logical argument, comes to a specific conclusion (Walliman, 2011)
- An analytical thesis statement which seeks to explore the relationship between two or more variables is typically argued via **induction**
	- This is the most common form of scientific argumentation today

## Statistics

- Not a pathway to knowledge based on certainty, but **probablility**
	- For example, we might be 95% certain that sea levels will rise 75m with a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 650ppm
	- Statistics is the appliance of mathematics and quantitive principles to the collection, ananlysis and presentation of numerical data
	- Statistical literacy is the ability to understand and critically evaluate statistical results

## Class Activity

### Problem scenario

- As this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5gtN16gOr8) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgleBkZMI3Y) suggests, FB users can have lots of friends:
	- We wonder what relationship there is, if any, between the number of Facebook friends we have, and how many true or close friends we have?
		- For example, people who have more Facebook friends might have **more** close friends than people who have fewer Facebook friends
- We also wonder whether any independent variables are related to user management of privacy:
	- We wonder if privacy and security are related to *indepedent variables* such as course, frequency of use, attitude to privacy, age or sex

### Research protocol

- We are documenting our own behaviour in FB and seeking to answer some research questions
	- This is being done as a class exercise and you have the option of not participating if you wish
	- No name identified data is being gathered and no third part access is to be provided
	- The data will be destroyed when the analysis is complete
	- An authentic research project of this kinda would require [Ethics Committee Approval](http://research.ecu.edu.au/grs/students/ethics.php)

### Social media

- A: Write a thesis statement for each of these problems
- B: What kind of thesis staetement/s have you written?
	- Argumentative
	- Analytic
	- Expository
- Now that you have decided on some thesis statements, what kind of research methods and design would you recommend?
- You may have concluded that they are suited to quantitative (empirical) investigation where we gather data from a sample of Facebook users about key variables
	- Number of Facebook friends and close friends
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Course
	- Frequency of use
	- Attitude to privacy

### Friends in Facebook

- We can express the phenomena of interest in terms of discrete Research Questions:
	- RQ1: Is the number of close friends a person has associated with the number of Facebook friends?
	- RQ2: Is privacy practice in Facebook related to attitudes to privacy?
- Hypothesis 1: The number of close friends a person has is positively associated with Facebook friends
- Hypothesis 2: Facebook users who are more concerned about privacy are more likely to use privacy settings

## Types of statistics

- There are two types of statistics
	- Descriptive statistics
	- Inferential statistics

### Descriptive statistics

- Numerical measures that describe a distribution by providing information on the central tendency of a distribution, the width of a distribution and the distribution's shape (Jackson, 2006, p. 95)

### Inferential statistics

- Procedures for drawing conclusions about a population based on data collected from a sample (Jackson, 2006, p. 144)

## Operational definitions

- Essential conditions for quantitative research include:	
	- The existence of one or more *operational definitions* that enable *constructs* in the research question to be treated as *variables*
		- For example, 'privacy practice' means actions taken in Facebook to restrict disclosure of content added
	- Studies usually include both *dependent* and *independent* variabls
		- What variables in our study are independent of the phenomenon being investigated?
		- Which are dependent?
	- A level or scale of measurement that matches the properties of the data

## Measurement scales

- There are **four** kinds of scales that might be used to measure variables (Jackson, 2006, p. 52)
	- Nominal scales
		- A scale in which objects or individuals are assigned to categories with no numerical properties
			- Male / female
			- Politics
			- Ethnic group
			- Device class
	- Ordinal scales
		- A scale in which objects or individuals are categorized and the categories form a rank order on a continuum
			- Percent rank
	- Interval scales
		- A scale in which the units of measurement (intervals) between the numbers on the scale are all equal in size
			- Temperature scale
	- Ratio scales
		- A scale in which in addition to order and equal units of measurement, there is an absolute 0 that indicates the absence of the variable being measured 
			- Centigrade may be considered a ratio scale
			- Whereas Fahrenheit is not

### Activity

- Match the following variables in our study to scale type:
	- Gender
	- Items of content published per month
	- Attitude to online privacy
		- ie. Online privacy is important to me, 5 point Likert
	- Age
	- One or more apps has been approved for sharing

## Objectives and design

- To summarise
	- The Facebook problem displays best fit with an empirical (quantitative) study based on induction
	- The objectives of our investigation are described by our Research Questions and hypotheses
	- To carry out the study, we collect data describing close friends, Facebook friends and privacy settings and seek to understand the relationship between these variables with mathematics
		- Statistics is science and practice of developing knowledge through the use of empirical data expressed in *quantitative* form
	- Philosophically this describes a path to knowledge based on *probability*, rather than *certainty*

## Data collection

- Add your data to the data collection sheet describing your Facebook behaviour for variables related to the research questinos
- Next we enter the data into our statistical analysis tool **SPSS**

## Data screening

- The purpose of data screening/cleaning is to:
	- Check if data have been entered correctly
		- ie. There are no errors in data collection
	- Check for missing values and deciding how to deal with the missing values
		- ie. We may exclude cases where FB or close friends have not been reported
	- Check for outliers
		- ie. These are values that are exceptional and may pose a problem for reliable analysis
	- Check for normality, and deciding how to deal with non-normality
		- The concept of values occuring within 3 Std. Dev. of the mean (average)
		- Normality checking is essential for choosing tests with good fit to the data
			- ie. Tests that are likely to be reliable

## Normal distribution

- A normal or regular distribution is represented by a bell curve
	- The standard normal distribution is a theoretical ideal normal distribution that generates a perfect bell curve
	- If scores are distributed according to the standard normal distribution, then:
		- The mean, mode, and median are located at the center point
	- The Mean **μ** is the average of all values
	- The Mode **_Mo_** is the value that occurs most frequently
	- The Median **_x_** is the middle score
	- The Standard Deviation **_s_** is the average distance of all the scores in the distribution, from the mean or the central point of the distribution

![standard normal distribution](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/standardizing.gif)

- With large amounts of data, screening is done by first calculating frequency distribution
- A frequency distribution is a count of cases corresponding to the attributes of an observed variable
- In SPSS, the frequency distribution is used to plot and check the distribution
- When Standard Deviation is half the mean, this describes good **central tendency**

## Measures of central tendency

- A distribution can also be described in terms of *central tendency*
- A measure of central tendency is a representative number describing the **middleness** of an entire set of data (Jackson, 2006)
- There are **three** classic measures of central tendency
	1. The mean: Average of all scores in the group
	2. The median: The middle score in the sorted distribution
		- The mean is influenced by outliers, so the median may be more representative of central tendency
	3. The mode: The score with the greatest frequency

## Measures of variation

- Measures of central tendency such as mean, mode and media are useful, but in any distribution of scores, we often need to know whether they are either clustered or spread out (Jackson, 2006)
	- For example, whether an exam has been well constructed and students well prepared is best determined by reviewing the spread or clusters of scores
- Two principle measures:
	- Range
	- Standard deviation

### Standard deviation

- Standard deviation (Jackson, 2006, p. 100) is the average distance of all the scores in the distribution from the mean or central point of the distribution

### Kurtosis and skew

- Outside the natural world, where distribution of parameters in populations often approaches the normal ideal, most distributions display **kurtosis** and **skew**
- Kurtosis is how flat or peaked a normal distribution is
- Skew describes the effect of extremely low or high score which push the curve positively or negatively

![skew](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Skew.png)

## z-Scores

- So far we have focused on measures aimed at assessing central tendency and variation involving a sample of scores
- If the focus shifts to a single score and the research question concerns how this score compares with other scores, then these methods are not appropriate
- A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviation units an individual's raw score falls from the mean of the distribution
- A z-score is calcualted using the following formula

![z-score formula](http://lrieber.coe.uga.edu/edit6900/resources/z_formula_large.gif)

### z-Score uses

- The z-score can be used to
	- Determine the probablity of a score occurring above or below the z-score, using z-tables
	- Determine percentile rank
		- ie. The percentage of scores equal to or below a score, using z-tables

## The equation editor

- Symbols such as **_mu_** **μ** or **sigma** **∑** are used in statistical formulae and in the reporting of some measures
- Use the equation editor in Word to access them

## Summary

- Descriptive statistics are used to measure central tendency and variation in scores
- Observations about central tendency and variation:
