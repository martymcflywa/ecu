The topic area this semester is **user motivation in the use of social media**

### Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish ###

The story of a brilliant engineer vs. a brilliant communicator, Wozniak vs. Jobs. **Who do we remember?**

##### Task: Steve Jobs #####
Watch [Steve Jobs 2005 Stanford Commencement Address](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwIzCGSdVNA) video: Review the video and decide whether Steve Jobs was effective as a communicator and why. For example, shaping message to event or audience, implying medium effectively, using gesture and tone, underlying reality and personal honesty. What does "stay hungry stay foolish" mean, and what does it mean for good career in ICT?

##### Answer: #####
- The speech was effective because the content was relevant to his audience. He used comic irony to engage attention and appeal to rebellious spirit of college students. Steve Jobs also split speach in 3 short parts, making it easier to digest and have 3 clear messages. He used personal, down to earth stories that anyone could relate to.
- Stay hungry, stay foolish: Always set goals, don't settle for the current status quo, don't censor yourself when coming up with ideas.

### Argumentation ###

Form of communication to persuade with effective reasoning, based on three components:
- Logic - effective reasoning.
- Rhetoric - art of oral persuasion.
- Dialectic - contest of ideas.
These ideas date back to Aristotle and Plato.

### Medium is the Message ###

McLuhan coined the phrase "the medium is the message to convey how communication channels shape messages". Is it any different communicating in a virtual environment? How is the internet any different?

##### Task: The Virtual Revolution #####
Watch [The Virtual Revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XADk9tHeJB8) video: Write down keywords that describes these differences. Describe implications flowing from these differences for communication. For example, SMS chat style writing resulting in dumbed down, de-evolving society. What does the image of monkeys infront of computers mean?

Noise - impedes effective communication

- distorts meaning of meaning intended by source
- syntactic noise produces technical distortion of messages
- semantic noise distorts the meaning of the message (interpretation and understanding). May be brought about by lack of communication skills, knowledge, attitudes or cultural differences
- we will looking at techniques to reduce the samntic noise of your communications

- being able to collate, manage, interpret, analyse and understand this information
- so that it may be reused to create new information that becomes part of your knowledge base

** task - are you an information literate person? if so, what makes you literate? what areas exist for improvement. Add feedback to Week 1 discussion forum.
