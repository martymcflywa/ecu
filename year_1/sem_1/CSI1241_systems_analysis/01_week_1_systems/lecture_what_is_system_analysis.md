### Unit Assessment Breakdown

| Assessment       | Weight |
|------------------|:------:|
| Online test      | 20%    |
| Group Assignment | 30%    |
| Exam             | 50%    |

**Note:** You need to achieve at least one half of the available marks to pass in the exam to pass the unit. Also need to score at least 50% overall in the unit.

- The assignment is based on a case study
- All materials available on Blackboard

## What is Systems Analysis?

- The start of the systems development process (before any programming occurs)
- A way to understand the problem before you solve it
	- Modelling
	- Abstracting and/or simplifying the problem
	- Removing noise from information
- A way to understand and communicate what a client actually wants done
	- Requirements elicitation and specification

## Why Do We Need Systems Analysis?

- Software development process is not visual
	- It involves converting an idea or concept into something tangible, for example program code
- Analysis can involve many stages and personnel from different areas of the business or even external stakeholders
	- Potential for mis-translation is high
- Large software systems are complex

### We really need analysis because:

- After numerous studies the conclusion is that no matter who does the work, the result tends to be the same
- The key indicators of project success or failure are:
	- User involvement
	- Executive management support
	- CLear statements of requirements

### When projects fail

- Not about money or time
- Because software is used everywhere, people's lives could be at risk if software does not function correctly
	- Example of radiation machine overdosing patients. See [Therac-25](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf) case.
	- Ariane 5 rocket explosion
	- FBI virtual case file system

## A Taxonomy of Systems Analysis Methods (Wood-Harper & Fitzgerald, 1982)

*See diagram in lecture pdf*

- Science
	- The scientific method
	- Newton, Descartes, Bacon, Hobbes, Locke

- Systems
	- A general systems approach
	- Von Bertalanffy, Weber, Durkheim, Ackhoff, Checkland

## Leading to Very Different World-Views (Burrell & Morgan, 1979)

- Functionalist
	- The world is composed of relatively concrete empirical artefacts and relationships
	- These artifacts can be identified and measured through approaches derived from natural sciences
	- Uses mechanical and biological analogies as a means of modelling

- Interpretivist
	- Nothing is created except by individuals within a social process

## What is a System?

Examples of systems:

- Computers (a system composed of other systems)
- Solar system
- Cardiovascular system
- Mathematical system (cartesian coordinates)
- Transport system
- A set of components which are related in some way to function as a unit with a common purpose
	- A chair
	- The Milky Way galaxy
	- The education system
	- A website
- For any system we should be able to list the components, the connections and state the purpose

- What are the components, connections and purpose of a football team? See `systems.todo`

- Some interesting things about a system:
	- Systems are holistic
	- Systems are connected
	- Can be composed of other systems
	- Can be impinged by other external systems
	- Have emergent properties that are not properties of the components. For example:
		- Water: Wetness is an emergent property of water that is not a property of individual components of water ie. hydrogen and oxygen
		- Human body: Life is an emergent property of the human body. If a finger is cut off, it is no longer alive.
		- Try to think of other examples. See `systems.todo`

## What is Information?

- Information is any form of communication that provides understandable and useful knowledge to the receiver.
- Behind communication there is usually data which has been presented in a way which is intended to be meaningful to the beholder. For example, what does the number 1337 represent to you?
	- Is 'leet' or 'elite' any clearer?
	- The point is that '1337' only has a meaning to humans, not computers
	- IT industry is said to speak in 'TLAs' - three letter acronyms to speed up communication amongst peers

### The DIKW Structure

DIKW is an acronym for Data Information Knowledge Wisdom.
See pp 23 for diagram, or [this](http://mdsiraj.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dikw-structure.jpg) image as an example.

## What is an information system?

An information system is a means of catering for the *flow* and *storage* of information to satisfy the requirements of all users. As well as storing data, it typically generates, manipulates and communicates information. Because the focus of interest is to do with what people do with information, information systems are an example of *human activity systems*. So we are saying that **people are actually part of** an information system.

- Flow of information: processing modelling
- Storage of information: data modelling

### Examples of Information Systems

- Blackboard
- Website
- Payroll system
- Order processing system
- Expert system that diagnoses illnesses
- Come up with 3 more examples - see `systems.todo`

## Components of an Information System

- Software
- Hardware
- People
- Procedures / rules
- Database
- Documentation

Should people be on the list? Refer back to **World Views** section where there were two outlooks, functionalist vs. interpretivist.

- Functionalist/Scientific view: people use devices like keyboards to get computers to do things, not part of the system
- Interpretivist view: People are part of a larger system that involves using computer which could be called 'how things happen in a business'

## What Does a System Analyst Do?

- Translates users' information needs into instructions for programmers to follow
- Analysts are paid more than programmers, need to deal with other people
- What would happen if analysts are removed from the equation and users had to deal directly with programmers?
	- Users and Programmers may not be able to understand each other
	- Their concerns are different
- Analysts are involved from the start of the project, through to the maintenance of an information system after deployment, also known as the 'system development lifecycle'

## What Kind of Knowledge Must a Systems Analyst Have

- List as many as you can think of based on the previous diagram
- Organise the list into categories or areas of knowledge. See `systems.todo`

**Possible Answers**

- Business knowledge
- Computer or technical knowledge
- Fact gathering skills
- Analysis skills
- Problem solving skills
- Communication skills
- People skills

Analysts are required to learn how the business works, to understand what the client needs.

- Would these attributes be important to a potential employer?
	- Problem solving skills are very important according to lecturer
- Analysts work with different groups of people, and will have different views, ideas and requirements

## Review

**Define the following terms:**

- information
- system
- information systems
- systems analysis
- human activity system
- skill
- knowledge

See `systems.todo`

**Will be helpful for exams.**
