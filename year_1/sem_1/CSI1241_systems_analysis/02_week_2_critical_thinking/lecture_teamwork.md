# Teamwork

## Introduction

If you work in IT, you will certainly need to work in teams. Team exercises occur throughout the degree in preparation for working in the IT industry.

- While the size of projects may vary, the reality is that most projects need more than one person because:
	- The deadline is so tight that one person can't complete the whole project in time
	- It is rare that one person will have all the skills and competencies required

There are downsides to working in teams:

- Communication between teams is an added burden
- Coordination between team members takes time and is an additional task
- Politics, conflict and different standards, agendas and expectations make teams less effective
- The number of lines of communication in team grows as additional members are added
- What are the number of possible communication paths for:
	- 1 person team
	- 2 person team
	- 3 persom team
	- 4 person team
- The formula is: `n(n-1)/2`

## Team

- A team is more than just a collective of individuals
- A team is formed from a group when individuals put the group before themselves
	- The team then becomes highly effective at getting the job done
	- When people come together and make the whole greater than the sum of the parts

## People Problems

- Team members do not work together efficiently
- Conflicts result in
	- Poor communication
	- Poor designs
	- Interface errors
	- Extra work
- Problem team members not removed from team
- Most qualified personnel not available
- Most qualified personnel not used
- Key personnel are available only part time
- People's assignments do not match their strengths
- Members leave before the project is complete
- Low motivation and morale reduce productivity

### Warning Signs

- "I don't need anyone to review my code"
- "No one else can fix the bugs in my code"
	- "I am too busy to fix them now, but i'll get to them next week"
- "I still think we ought to go back and change the design we were talking about last month"
- "No one tells us anything and we get most of our information from the grapevine"
- "It's just another job with people telling us what to do"
- "I don't know how to explain my design, I just know that it works"
- "My code is too complicated to test"

### Know Thyself First

- In order to perform well in a team, you have to know yourself first
- Otherwise you won't understand how your behaviour affects others and how you can fit into a team
- To begin with, there must be:
	- Self reflection of goals
	- Self knowledge of strengths and weaknesses
	- Self appreciation of skills and behaviour within a team, especially at critical times
- Next stage is to observe what effects your behaviour and actions have on other team members:
	- If you are late to a meeting, how are you treated?
	- Was the treatment reasonable?
	- How did you react to the treatment?

	- The roles that each is expected to undertake
	- The standards expected by the group
