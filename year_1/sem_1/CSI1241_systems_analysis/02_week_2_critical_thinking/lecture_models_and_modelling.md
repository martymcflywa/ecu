# Models and Modelling

>The starting point of analysis is the diagram... Any pattern which, by being abstracted from a real situation, conveys the physical influence of certain demands or forces is a diagram.

>Christopher Alexander (1964)

## Purpose of Modelling

- Simplify reality
- Validate some assertions about reality
- Communicate an aspect of a problem to another party

## Modelling as a Cognitive Exercies

>Johnson-Laird, 1983, p. 10)

- Human beings understand the world by constructing working models of it in their minds
- These models are incomplete, so they are simplified
- Models contain elements that are imitations of reality
- No working model of how their counterparts in the real world operate, but only procedures that mimic behaviour
- Korzybski "The map was not the territory"

## Mapping Reality to the Machine World

>Wand and Weber (1993)

## Types of Models

- Informal
	- Rich pictures
- Semi-formal
	- [UML](http://www.visual-paradigm.com/VPGallery/diagrams/UseCase.html)
- Formal
	- Mathematical expressions
		- See Sommerville, 2001, pp. 205

## Things to Think About

- How to know if the model is correct?
- How to know if the model reflects reality?
- Is the model a useful communication tool?

## Summary

- Modelling is a way to simplify reality
- Not as easy as it seems
- There are many types of models that can represent systems
	- Varying level of formalities
- Models are only models
